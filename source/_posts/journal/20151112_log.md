## How to install Atom in Gentoo
The package of atom for Gentoo is not available at Atom office site, but source file of which is available. Unfortunately, we will stuck in the *compiling module ...* when we compile the atom source.
### Installation

Following is the overlay including atom package called `aegyipus`, which is personal Gentoo overlay.
```bash
# run as root
layman -o http://aegypius.github.io/overlay/repositories.xml -f -a aegypius
emerge atom-bin # Not atom, it occurs errors when the source is being compiled too!
```
If there is no ebuilds to satisfy "atom-bin", you should update you layman setup.
add `source /var/lib/layman/make.conf` to `/etc/portage/make.conf`.

### Tweak

If you want to have a live preview for typing markdown text, the shortcut is `CTRL_SHIFT_M`. If it doesn't work, open the package option and download `preview` plugin.

## `git fetch` method
If we want to keep local up-to-date with ignoring difference between git and local, we have an alternative approach:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:cynorr/example.git
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master #origin is your remote repository
```
